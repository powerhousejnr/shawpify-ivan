Hey Folks,

In order to get the login functionality working, you'll need to first setup a database called "shawpify2017" using the phpmyadmin interface.
I recommend the same settings as you saw in the practical.
Then, in the SQL tab in phpmyadmin, copy the sql code from shawpify2017.sql (in this folder) to the text input and run to add the tables used for the login functionality.
How the above actually works will be explained in further detail in the Servers & Databases semester.

Enjoy, and see you soon.
